HR DATA ANALYTICS 
Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a detailed analysis of employee attendance by leveraging an Excel dataset. The dataset was first cleaned and structured into a required format, followed by the creation of necessary DAX measures for calculating key attendance metrics.

Key Metrics
The dashboard captures and visualizes the following employee attendance insights:

Presence % - Percentage of employees present on a given day.
Work from Home (WFH) % - Percentage of employees working remotely.
Sick Leave (SL) % - Percentage of employees on sick leave.
Data Processing & Visualization
Data Cleaning & Preparation:

The raw dataset was formatted to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Unnecessary columns were removed, missing values handled, and date formats standardized.
DAX Formulas & Measures:

Created custom measures using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to calculate the percentage of presence, WFH, and sick leaves.
Aggregated data based on employee attendance records to generate insights.
Dashboard Elements:

Employee Table: Displays individual attendance percentages (Presence, WFH, SL).
Trends Over Time: Line charts visualizing the trends of attendance, remote work, and sick leave percentages over time.
Day-of-Week Insights: Breakdown of attendance trends based on weekdays.
Matrix View: Displays employees' attendance status across different dates, indicating whether they were present in the office, working remotely, or on sick leave.
Key Findings
The dashboard enables HR teams and management to track attendance trends, analyze remote work patterns, and identify days with high absenteeism.
Presence, WFH, and SL trends help in workforce planning and decision-making.
Tools & Technologies Used
Power BI for data visualization
Excel for data preprocessing
DAX for measure calculations
